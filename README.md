I built this movie website using react js .
We have a search input form , where users can search any movie name, and based on that query we show them the results . 

#API Used for this Project 
 http://www.omdbapi.com/ 
 
 # Build this project using 
 1. UseParamS  :- we could access that particular string or value in the route by calling the useParams hook , using useParams i can fetch data or details of particular movie using its id .
 2. UseContext :- The main idea of using the context is to allow your components to access some global data and re-render when that global data is changed. Context solves the props drilling problem: when you have to pass down props from parents to children.
 3. Router :- React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL . 
 4. Paginaion :- we can split our large dataset into chunks ( or pages ) that we can gradually fetch and display to the user .
